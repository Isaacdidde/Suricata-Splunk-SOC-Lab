SOC homelab using Suricata IDS/IPS, Wireshark traffic analysis,  Splunk log monitoring, and Bash automation scripts.
# Suricata–Splunk SOC Homelab

## Overview
This repository documents a hands-on SOC homelab built to understand
network traffic analysis, intrusion detection and prevention, log monitoring,
and automation using Bash scripting.

## Tools & Technologies
